# **Machine Learning Project: Classification & Regression Analysis**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project explores key machine learning concepts, focusing on **inductive bias, classification, and regression models**. It includes a detailed analysis of how machine learning models generalize, how different learning tasks are applied in real-world scenarios, and how predictive models can be built and evaluated.  

The project consists of the following tasks:  
1. **Inductive Bias in Machine Learning** – Understanding how models generalize from training data.  
2. **Learning Tasks: Classification and Regression** – Analyzing the impact of advertising budgets on sales.  
3. **Tennis Data Analysis** – Predicting whether a person will play tennis based on weather conditions.

## **Task Summaries**  

### **1️⃣ Inductive Bias in Machine Learning**  
- Inductive bias refers to the assumptions a model makes to generalize from training data.  
- Types of inductive bias include **representational bias, preference bias, and learning algorithm bias**.  
- **Example:** CNNs use spatial hierarchy to efficiently process images, improving recognition accuracy.  

### **2️⃣ Learning Tasks: Classification & Regression**  
- **Regression Analysis:** Predicting sales based on advertising budgets (TV, Radio, Newspaper).  
- **Key Findings:**  
  - **TV ads** have the strongest impact on sales (**0.78 correlation**).  
  - **Regression Model:** Sales = `7.12 + 0.0465 × TV Ad Budget`.  
- **Classification Task:** Predicting "High Sales" vs. "Low Sales" using logistic regression.  

### **3️⃣ Tennis Data Analysis**  
- Predicting whether a person plays tennis based on weather conditions.  
- **Classification models used:** Decision Trees, Naïve Bayes, k-NN.  
- **Model accuracy:** Evaluated using **precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix**.

## **Installation & Setup**  

### **1️⃣ Install Dependencies**  
Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.8+ recommended). Then, install the required packages:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **2️⃣ Run Data Analysis & Model Training**  
To explore the dataset and train models, open the Jupyter notebooks:  

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open and run the notebook files inside the `notebooks/` directory.  

### **3️⃣ Running Predictions**  
You can run predictions using the trained models:  

```python
python src/predict.py --input "Sunny, Cool, High, True"
```

## **Results & Insights**  
- Regression models help predict continuous values (e.g., sales revenue).  
- Classification models make categorical predictions (e.g., playing tennis or not).  
- Decision Trees provide explainable rules for classification problems.  
- Inductive bias plays a crucial role in how well a model generalizes to unseen data.

## **Future Improvements**  
🔹 Extend analysis with **deep learning models** (e.g., neural networks).  
🔹 Apply **ensemble methods** (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for better accuracy.  
🔹 Improve dataset size and diversity to enhance model generalization.
